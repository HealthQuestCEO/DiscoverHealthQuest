  <h2>😐 The Bully's Change</h2>
  <p>Your name is Tyler. At home, yelling and teasing are normal. Your older brother always makes fun of you, and your dad says you need to "toughen up."</p>
  <p>So at school, you act tough. Today, you made a mean comment about someone’s clothes. Everyone laughed—but the kid looked upset.</p>
  <p>What do you do?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene2')">Keep acting like it’s a joke</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Start to wonder if it was wrong</button>
</div>

<div id="scene2" class="scene">
  <p>You say, “Can’t take a joke?” and walk off. But all day, the kid avoids you. It doesn’t feel as funny now.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene4')">Ignore the feeling</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Think more about it</button>
</div>

<div id="scene3" class="scene">
  <p>You remember how you felt when your brother made fun of you. It didn’t feel like a joke then.</p>
  <p>Now you’re not sure if what you did was okay.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Talk to a teacher or coach</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene6')">Try to make it right yourself</button>
</div>

<div id="scene4" class="scene">
  <p>You act like it’s no big deal. But later, your teacher asks to speak with you. She says someone reported feeling hurt by your words.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Open up and talk honestly</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene7')">Say it wasn’t your fault</button>
</div>

<div id="scene5" class="scene">
  <p>You talk to your coach. “At home, people talk like that all the time,” you say.</p>
  <p>Your coach says, “That might be what you learned—but it doesn’t mean it’s right.”</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene8')">Decide to change</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene9')">Stay quiet but think more</button>
</div>

<div id="scene6" class="scene">
  <p>You walk up to the kid and say, “I’m sorry I said that. I’m still learning what’s okay and what’s not.”</p>
  <p>They nod. “Thanks for saying that.”</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Be more kind moving forward</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Just give them space</button>
</div>

<div id="scene7" class="scene">
  <p>You say, “They’re too sensitive.” But the teacher says, “We’re all learning. Think about your impact, not your intent.”</p>
  <p>You leave the room thinking about it.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Reflect honestly</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene10')">Stay defensive</button>
</div>

<div id="scene8" class="scene">
  <p>You decide you don’t want to be someone who hurts others. You ask for help learning better ways to handle your feelings.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Start fresh</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Apologize quietly</button>
</div>

<div id="scene9" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You didn’t speak up yet, but now you see things differently. That’s the first step to real change.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try again</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene13')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene10" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You stayed defensive. But inside, you’re wondering what kindness might look like next time.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try again</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene13')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene11" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You didn’t say much, but you changed your actions. That’s a start—and it matters.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Restart</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene14')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene12" class="scene">
  <h3>✨ You Are a Kindness Hero! ✨</h3>
  <p>You learned a new way to treat others—and yourself—with respect and care.</p>
  <p>🏅 <em>You’ve earned the Kindness Hero badge!</em></p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try a new path</button>
</div>

<div id="scene13" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You’re still learning—but now you know: what you do can hurt or heal. And it’s your choice.</p>
</div>

<div id="scene14" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You chose to change—and that takes strength. You’re building a kinder version of you.</p>
</div>
