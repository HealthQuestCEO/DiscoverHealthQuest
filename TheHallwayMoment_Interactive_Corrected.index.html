  <h2>🌟 The Hallway Moment</h2>
  <p>You’re walking down the hallway at school when you hear laughter. You turn the corner and see Max, a student from your class, standing alone. His backpack is on the ground, and papers are everywhere. Two kids nearby are whispering and giggling.</p>
  <p>What do you do?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene2')">Help Max pick up his papers</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Pretend you didn’t see anything</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene4')">Ask the kids what happened</button>
</div>

<div id="scene2" class="scene">
  <p>You walk over to Max and help him gather his things. He looks surprised, then smiles. “Thanks,” he says quietly.</p>
  <p>One of the kids who was giggling watches you but doesn’t say anything.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Ask Max if he wants to walk with you to class</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene6')">Say “no problem” and leave quickly</button>
</div>

<div id="scene3" class="scene">
  <p>You keep walking, pretending you didn’t see anything. But you feel a little weird inside. Something about it doesn’t sit right.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene2')">Go back to help Max</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene10')">Keep going and try not to think about it</button>
</div>

<div id="scene4" class="scene">
  <p>You ask, “What happened?” The kids shrug. “He just tripped,” one says. Max is still on the ground, looking upset.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene2')">Help Max anyway</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Walk away</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene7')">Tell the kids it’s not nice to laugh</button>
</div>

<div id="scene5" class="scene">
  <p>You and Max walk to class together. He says, “People do that a lot to me. It’s really hard.”</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Keep being his friend</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Say goodbye at the door and smile</button>
</div>

<div id="scene6" class="scene">
  <p>You say “no problem” and walk off fast. You helped—but now you wonder: did Max want a friend, too?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Go back and ask to walk together</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Keep going</button>
</div>

<div id="scene7" class="scene">
  <p>You say, “That’s not really funny. He looks upset.” The kids shrug and walk away. Max looks up. “Thanks for saying that.”</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Sit with Max at lunch later</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Smile and head to class</button>
</div>

<div id="scene10" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You didn’t help, and now you’re not sure if you made the right choice. Have you ever wished someone had helped you?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try again</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene13')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene11" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You helped—and that’s awesome! Even small kindness can make a big difference.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Restart</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene14')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene12" class="scene">
  <h3>✨ You Are a Kindness Hero! ✨</h3>
  <p>You stood up for someone else and showed true courage and care.</p>
  <p>🏅 <em>You’ve earned the Kindness Hero badge!</em></p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try a new path</button>
</div>

<div id="scene13" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You didn’t get involved this time. But now you know how it feels. Next time, you might choose differently—and that’s how we grow. 💪</p>
</div>

<div id="scene14" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You took action! You helped someone feel seen. Kindness grows when we’re brave enough to use it. 🌱</p>
