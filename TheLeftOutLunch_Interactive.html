  <h2>🚫 The Left-Out Lunch</h2>
  <p>You’re walking into the cafeteria with your tray when you see Sam sitting alone. Yesterday, he tried to sit with your group but no one moved over.</p>
  <p>Your friends are already waving for you to join them.</p>
  <p>What do you do?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene2')">Invite Sam to sit with your group</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene3')">Sit with Sam at a different table</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene4')">Sit with your usual group</button>
</div>

<div id="scene2" class="scene">
  <p>You wave Sam over. “Want to sit with us today?”</p>
  <p>He looks surprised, then smiles and grabs his tray.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Start a fun conversation</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene6')">Let him sit quietly</button>
</div>

<div id="scene3" class="scene">
  <p>You sit next to Sam. “Mind if I join you?” you ask.</p>
  <p>He nods. “Thanks,” he says quietly. You both eat together in peace.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene5')">Ask him about his day</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene6')">Just be a quiet friend</button>
</div>

<div id="scene4" class="scene">
  <p>You sit with your usual friends. Sam stays alone again.</p>
  <p>You notice he barely eats and keeps his head down.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene7')">Check on him after lunch</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene8')">Stay with your group and move on</button>
</div>

<div id="scene5" class="scene">
  <p>You ask Sam what his favorite food is. He lights up and starts talking about his grandma’s cooking.</p>
  <p>The table joins in and everyone laughs—together.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Keep including him</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Let him enjoy the moment</button>
</div>

<div id="scene6" class="scene">
  <p>You don’t say much, but your actions speak loudly. Sam eats quietly, but doesn’t look sad anymore.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Ask him to play at recess</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Smile and clean up together</button>
</div>

<div id="scene7" class="scene">
  <p>You find Sam by his cubby. “Hey, I saw you were alone at lunch. Want to join us tomorrow?”</p>
  <p>He nods. “That’d be nice.”</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene12')">Make space tomorrow</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene11')">Walk to class together</button>
</div>

<div id="scene8" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>You stayed with your group. But later, you wonder—how would it feel to be left out like that?</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try again</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene13')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene11" class="scene">
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>Kindness doesn’t always need big words. Your actions made someone feel welcome.</p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Restart</button>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene14')">Go to an ending</button>
</div>

<div id="scene12" class="scene">
  <h3>✨ You Are a Kindness Hero! ✨</h3>
  <p>You made sure no one had to eat alone. That kind of kindness is unforgettable.</p>
  <p>🏅 <em>You’ve earned the Kindness Hero badge!</em></p>
  <button onclick="showScene('scene1')">Try a new path</button>
</div>

<div id="scene13" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You didn’t act this time. But now you know how one seat at lunch can change a day.</p>
</div>

<div id="scene14" class="scene">
  <h3>Ending</h3>
  <p>You made space. You shared your table and your kindness. That’s how friendships begin.</p>
